**EpochEdge**, a website where multiple people can easily download their photos of an event they attended. The most creative idea of this website is Face Recognition System. We have mainly 3 features.
 First, "Get Session Images" section helps the users to download all the session or event images. The user must submit the 'Session username' to download the images.
 Second, "Upload your images" section helps the photographer to upload all the session images. On the time of uploading the images, Photographer must create a unique username to upload images and that session username must be circulated among the event attendees. 
Third, "Get your own images" section helps to download only those images in which user is present. In this case user have to take a photo for face scanning and his images will compare through Face Recognition System and downloading automatically.

Important Note: Photographer can upload the images with a unique session username for every different events, that must be known to users to download the images.
